# Design Tokens Studio PoC

This PoC is because I was inspired by my friend Jyrmid, so I wanted to create the PoC by myself and also share a functional approach with the world.

## Motivation

Nowadays the [Design Tokens](https://thedesignsystem.guide/design-tokens) are very common within the UI/UX design and Frontend Community to have a standard way for naming components and UI/UX elements. However, keeping a unique source of truth is difficult and we do not want to make difficult the cognitive load for UI/UX designer nor developers.

## Goal

Define a simple approach to sync the `Design Tokens` created with Tokens Studio in **Figma**. These tokens can be used by developers and other designers.

## Key Considerations

- Designer should not download any tool / local development environment.
- Tokens should be centralized to keep a unique source of information shared between designers and developers
